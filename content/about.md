Hi, I'm Gianni.

Software developer with over five years' experience in implementing a variety of innovative products on the mobile, wearable and medical startups. Also worked on a large-scale global e-commerce company for two and half years with global teams.
Iâ€™m looking forward to bringing together professionals from various fields to solve difficult problems in the world.
Hope I can do something for human beings on the earth. As a coder, book lover, enthusiastic cyclist, type 1 diabetic.
